## Introduction

Hello everyone,

Welcome to our ESILV A4 project: "A Market Risk Tour of Risk Measures and How to Liquidate Portfolios Using the Linear Almgren-Chriss Model and Wavelet Evaluation." This project delves into the intricate world of market risk assessment, exploring various risk measures and advanced models for portfolio liquidation.

In this GitHub repository, we have curated all the essential components of our project, including code implementations, documentation, and supplementary resources. Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of different risk measures commonly used in finance and to demonstrate the application of the linear Almgren-Chriss model and wavelet evaluation techniques in portfolio liquidation strategies.

Through this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of market risk dynamics and showcase practical methodologies for managing portfolio liquidation efficiently.

We encourage you to explore our GitHub repository and engage with us by sharing your insights, feedback, or questions. Your input is invaluable in enriching our exploration of market risk assessment and portfolio liquidation strategies.

Thank you for joining us on this enlightening journey through the world of market risk and portfolio management!

Best regards,
